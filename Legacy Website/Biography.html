                    <h3> Hello! </h3>
                    My name is William Cheng and I'm a candidate for a bachelors degree in Computer Science under the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I have had 2 years of formal programming training in both Java and C++, and I additionally have further experience in front end web development. I am looking forward to creating new connections and contributing my skills and knowledge towards new and interesting endeavors. For the past 4 years I have been heavily involved in my robotics team - working as the director of programming to help organize and divide labor across the division.
